  Semester 4 | Software Design Architechture | Final QAP
</h1>

Design and implementation of a RESTful API for a single resource, employing the RepositoryRestResource design pattern taught in class. Subsequently, the API is subjected to local testing within a Docker container environment.

  <summary><h3><strong>Assignment Instructions</strong></h3></summary>
  <blockquote>
  <br/>
  For this QAP Iâ€™d like you to get hands on practice building a simple REST API for one simple 
  Resource following the RepositoryRestResource pattern we covered in our classes and then 
  testing it in a running Docker container locally.

  You can create a new API for any Resource you like.

  You should build out a new project from scratch, build up your pom file with the required 
  dependencies, add the required dockerfile and docker-compose files as well as your 
  RepositoryRestResource implementation.  

  Testing in postman is all that is required.

  Deliverables:
  -	GitHub Link to project
  -	Testing Screen Shots from postman and screen shots of the project running in docker.
  -	Details in the project readme about the new API and how to run project in docker.
